The idea is to make a working agar.io-like game in 2D, already scaled to support 3D.
Then i'll have to make it playable in 3D, including smooth camera and player moves, with 3D functions library.

### 2D Game ###

# Backend

- Get bigger on collisions (? should i? maybe only center needs to collide)
- Spawn some 'food' planet
- Close socket listener for keys when player is dead

- 'Pack' the game in a single node module, with only needed elements accessible (ie. no global variable)
- Smooth moves
- Disconnect player when he leaves

# Frontend

- Reinstanciate bigger sphere when receiving a size bigger than actual one.

### 3D Game ###

# Backend

- Think about 3D mode

# Frontend

- Think about 3D mode
