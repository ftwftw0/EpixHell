The idea is to make a working agar.io-like game in 2D, already scaled to support 3D.
Then i'll have to make it playable in 3D, including smooth camera and player moves, with 3D functions library.

### 2D Game ###

# Backend

- Get bigger - set collisions
- Spawn some 'food' planet
- Eat people smaller
-- Set full code to 'strict mode'; for both server and clients. Seems more explicit, avoiding incomprehensions.

   Setting to strict mode allows you to use real NodeJS OOP, which wont replicate all class code into each
   instance of an 'object' (...optimizition!).
- 'Pack' the game in a single node module, with only needed elements accessible
- Smooth moves
- Disconnect player when he leaves

# Frontend

### 3D Game ###

# Backend

- Think about 3D mode
